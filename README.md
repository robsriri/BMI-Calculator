# BMI-Calculator
      
    This repsitory contains a python file that opens a simple PyWebIO script to calculate the BMI.  
    I discovered that it's just a very simple script if you ignore PyWebIO, but after using the input and output functions 
    provided by PyWebIO, you can interact with the  code in the browser.

    This script is exactly the same as the sample provided in the documentation at-
